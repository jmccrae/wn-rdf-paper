\section{Introduction}

WordNet is one of the oldest lexical resource for natural
language processing and it continues to be widely used. In the time since the first version of WordNet was released many
resources have been produced that represent complementary information~\cite{schuler2005verbnet,baker1998berkeley} or extend
the WordNet model to new languages~\cite{vossen1998eurowordnet,bond2013linking}. 
Meanwhile, in recent years we have seen
the development of Web technologies for the representation of language resources
and in particular, by the use of linked data. This has lead to the Linguistic Linked
Open Data Cloud, which is constructed by linking resources and publishing them
on the web using RDF. Linked data, as proposed by \cite{berners2011linked}, has four
main principles for publishing data: firstly, that it use URIs to identify
objects; secondly, that these URIs should be resolvable; thirdly, that semantic
information is returned, using standards such as RDF and finally, that links are
provided to other resources. 
Finally, recent activity in the context of the ontology-lexicon interface has
led to the creation of a number of models, most notably
\lemon{}~\cite{mccrae2012interchanging}, which give a principled method of
relating words to ontological concepts. Given the wide popularity of WordNets in
many languages it is important to clarify how WordNets can be integrated in
the context of an ontology-lexicon model.


In this paper we describe our experience
in publishing WordNet following the linked data principles. While this is not
the first version of WordNet to be published as linked data~\cite{van2006conversion,mccrae2012integrating,graves2006data}, our 
version has several advantages: firstly that it is well-linked to many
resources, secondly that it uses an open model in \emph{lemon} and finally that as
it is integrated with the development of WordNet, and as such will be updated alongside
future releases of WordNet.

\section{Background}

\subsection{WordNet}

WordNet~\cite{miller1995wordnet,fellbaum1998wordnet,fellbaum2010wordnet} is a large lexical database of English nouns,
verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Word forms are grouped into more than 117,000 sets of
roughly synonymous word forms ("synsets"). These are interconnected by bidirectional
arcs that stand for lexical (word-word) and semantic (synset-synset) relations, including
hyper/hyponymy (\emph{tree-oak}), meronymy (\emph{tree-branch}), antonymy
(\emph{long-short}) and various entailment relations (\emph{buy-pay, show-see, untie-
tie}).

WordNet's synsets and its network structure yield a rough measure of semantic similarity
among words and concepts in terms of synset membership as well as the number of arcs
separating synsets. Consequently, WordNet has become a popular tool for Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) and Natural Language Processing in general. WordNets have
been built for some 100 different languages. Most are mapped onto the Princeton
WordNet, enabling translation on the lexical level as well as cross-lingual WSD and
applications. WordNet continues to evolve both in terms of coverage and representation
of meaning. Recent enhancements include the addition of internet language and partially
compositional multi­word­units. Finally, WordNet has been mapped to formal ontologies, 
including SUMO~\cite{niles2003mapping} and KYOTO~\cite{vossen2011kyoto}.

\subsection{lemon}

\lemon{} is a model that has been proposed~\cite{mccrae2012interchanging} for the representation of
lexicons relative to ontologies. As such, this model is well suited to the
representation of semantic networks such as WordNet and defines many useful
features for linking a WordNet to wider objects in the Semantic Web. \lemon{}
models lexicons by means of a core consisting of the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{lexical entry} which represents a single word or multi-word
    unit.
  \item A \emph{lexical sense}, representing a meaning of that word, which
    contains a \emph{reference} to a concept in the ontology.
  \item \emph{Forms}, which are inflected version of the entry, and associated
    with a string \emph{representation}.
\end{itemize}

In fact, in previous work~\cite{eckle2014lemonuby} \lemon{} has been used not only to
represent WordNet but to integrate it with more syntactically sophisticated
resources such as VerbNet. As such \lemon{} shows potential to help in the
integration of lexical data across many levels and languages.

\subsection{Linguistic Linked Data}

The application of linked data technology to the representation of linguistics
resources has been spearheaded by the OKFN Working Group on Linguistics~\cite{chiarcos2011towards},
who has been mapping the progress of this project by means of a cloud
diagram showing how all the existing resources are linked. 
There are many key advantages to the use
of this technology for language resources; however the cloud has until now
lacked a central node. As WordNet is the most widely referenced language
resource, we believe that WordNet can act as a nucleus for linguistic linked data
in the way that DBpedia~\cite{auer2007dbpedia} has for the wider cloud.

\cite{chiarcos2013towards} discuss the
application to linguistic data and show that this model has notable
advantages over standard approaches to data modelling, in particular the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Representation: Graph-based models are a method that can represent any
        form of language resource.
    \item Structural interoperability: By using RDF graphs and URIs, datasets can
        be merged with no effort.
    \item Federation: Multiple datasets can easily be drawn from different
        sources in the web and used together seamlessly.
    \item Conceptual interoperability: Linking to common data category
        repositories allows common definitions to be inferred.
    \item Ecosystem: Building on standards such as RDF, allows the use of common
        tools, including databases.
    \item Dynamic import: Data on the web is not static and as such errors can
        be corrected after publication.
    \item Expressivity: The use of other Semantic Web models allows the easy
        expression of metadata, provenance and ontological constraints on the
        data.
\end{enumerate}

\end{table}

It is not trivial to apply \lemon{} to the case of a WordNet as there is no
clear ontology, so we describe our mapping here.
Clearly, WordNet's 
words can be called lexical entries and the word senses correspond
well to the concept of lexical senses. WordNet has lemmas and a separate list of
variants of these, and as such we create a canonical form for each lemma and another 
form for each of these variants. Since there is currently no indication in
WordNet of what grammatical properties these variants have, we do not distinguish
these forms by means of annotation. As \lemon{} is a model for
ontology-lexica, the main question is what the reference of the sense should be.
We approach this by saying that the synsets of WordNet are the ontological
references, but instead of assigning them a formal ontological type (e.g.,
class, property or individual) we introduce a new type {\tt Synset},
which is typed as a {\tt Concept} from the SKOS~\cite{miles2007skos} vocabulary.
This allows us to capture the nature of synsets without
ontologizing the semantic network as in~\cite{gangemi2003ontowordnet}.
Similarly, we introduce relations such as hypernymy, meronymy etc. as new
properties rather than attempt to relate them to existing ontological
properties such as OWL's sub class of. In order to capture the new properties we
introduce an ontology\footnote{\url{http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology}}
describing the new properties and classes and providing
axioms for the use in the context of both \lemon{} and SKOS. Furthermore, we
link the elements in the ontology to data categories from
ISOcat~\cite{kemps2008isocat} following the guidelines
of~\cite{windhouwer2012linking}.

Another key question concerns the identifiers we use for each element in the data.
We do not follow previous exports such as~\cite{van2006conversion} in assigning new identifiers
but instead attempt to use the existing identifiers in WordNet. Furthermore, as
WordNet has released several versions and is still under development, we consider it 
important to include the version number in the URI. As such, we use the
following scheme for URIs, as exemplified in figure \ref{uri-examples}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Each lexical entry is represented by means of the URL-encoded lemma and
    then a dash followed by the part of speech as a single letter (i.e., `n(oun)',
    `v(erb)', `a(djective)', `r (adverb)', `adjective s(atellite)' or `p(article)').
  \item Senses and forms in the model use the entry URI and add a fragment
    identifier. For forms, for which there is no previous identifier in WordNet, we
    use {\tt CanonicalForm} and {\tt Form-n} where {\tt n} is a number.
    For senses, the fragment is the index of the senses and the part of
    speech.
  \item Synsets are similarly the 8 or 9 figure\footnote{The 9 figure codes
      include an extra initial digit for part-of-speech} `offset' code from the WordNet
    database, followed by a dash and the part of speech as a single letter.
\end{itemize}


A Python framework based on RDFlib\footnote{\url{https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib}} is used to serve the website and
provide SPARQL access to the data.

\section{Linking WordNet}

In addition to providing a RDF version of WordNet we incorporated a number
of extra resources founded from other sources into the RDF data. In particular
we include the following elements:

\begin{itemize}
  \item For verbs, we include mappings to VerbNet~\cite{schuler2005verbnet} where extant. As
    VerbNet does not currently have a linked data version, we link to the
    PHP page of the web site.
  \item We include translations from the Open Multilingual WordNet~\cite{bond2013linking}
    collection as simple labels on the synsets, identified by the use of
    language codes.
  \item We have mapped previous mappings to LexVo~\cite{de2008language} 
    using the current identifiers in WordNet.
  \item We include links to the W3C WordNet 2.0 export~\cite{van2006conversion}.
  \item We have created new links to the lemonUby~\cite{eckle2014lemonuby} resource.
\end{itemize}

In addition to these links we provide support for legacy resources by
adding URL mappings from previous versions of WordNet identifiers to the most
recent version, with mappings based on \cite{daude2000mapping}. The number of
triples in the resource can be seen in table~\ref{triple_counts} and an example
of the data is illustrated in figure~\ref{modelling_example}.

\section{Related Work}

This work does not represent the first version of WordNet made available in RDF; 
\cite{van2006conversion,mccrae2012integrating} have made previous
version available directly in WordNet. Furthermore, WordNet has been
incorporated into various larger resources including
BabelNet~\cite{navigli2010babelnet,ehrmann2014} and 
UBY~\cite{gurevych2012uby,eckle2014lemonuby}. These projects however have mostly
been fixed to using a single version of WordNet. In contrast, we view our work
as more related to task of providing universal identifiers for words as in the
ongoing work of the Global WordNet Grid~\cite{pease2008building}.  

There have been a number of attempts to interlink WordNets. 
\cite{pease2009formal} used an upper-level ontology called SUMO to group WordNet
concepts and these mappings are adopted by several language versions of WordNet.
Similarly, attempts were made to integrate WordNets based around the Kyoto
Ontology and LMF~\cite{soria2009wordnet}. Finally, the SemLink
project~\cite{palmer2009semlink} has
developed links among several resources, though it is not yet integrated into
the linked data cloud.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented the creation of a WordNet RDF version that is
linked with the development of the existing model and incorporates a
large number of links to other resources on the web. Furthermore, we discussed 
the use of the \lemon{} model to describe a WordNet and ameliorate the
integration of not just other WordNets but also a wide variety of lexical
resources that are integrated with WordNet. We believe that our WordNet RDF model 
will constitute a key central node for the expansion of the Linguistic
Linked Open Data Cloud.
